starred-items
=============

This is a repository that will help improve my Google Reader to Pocket workflow.  Currently, I use IFTTT to send my starred items in Google Reader over to Pocket.  With that said, I first needed a way to get all my old items out of Google Reader into Pocket.  Second, I needed a way to remove these starred items in Google Reader once I've actioned them in Pocket.  For example, I send items over to https://pinboard.in/u:ryankanno/ from Pocket - once I've deleted the item from Pocket, I need to ultimately remove the same item from my starred feed.
